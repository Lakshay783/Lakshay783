## Hi there 👋
I'm Lakshay, a software engineer based in India.
I design and build whatever I can imagine.
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.
My main tech stack is html,css,javascript,react,node.js,mongodb.
I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the Raasta-fix.
I've built over 1 public repos, but privately.. it's probably more than 1 at this point.

Fun Facts:

I have a dog.
I don't like coffee or tea.
Naruto is my favorite anime
Hobbies: anime, gaming, building things.
